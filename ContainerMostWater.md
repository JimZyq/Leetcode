# Container Most Water
**Solution:** I learned this method from the solution, it's really smart. The water size is only affected by the minimum number of the a<sub>i</sub> and a<sub>j</sub>. We know two facts: 1.The longer the range of the two side is better 2. The longer the minimum of the two edgeåœ¨ is better. The initial state is the most range. Everytime moves the shorter edge one distance near the middle. Find the maximum size of this traversal. 

**Time Complexity:** O(n)

**Space Complexity:** O(1)


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int min(int a, int b){
        int r;
        a<=b?r=a:r=b;
        return r;
    }
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int n = height.size();
        int i=0,j=n-1,max=0,tmp;
        while(i<j){
            tmp = (j-i)*min(height[i],height[j]);
            min(max,tmp)==max?max=tmp:max=max;
            min(height[i],height[j])==height[i]?i++:j--;
        }
        return max;
    }
};
